This Repository to make me think in python all the time.
You will see python related labs, which aims to polish my skill in the language.
First I will start with simple questions and build up bit by bit. 
an extra outcome, is to make this a ready source library for my future codes once I become efficient in making models  and creating useful classes.

I will list all my labs in here to be a reverence.

My goal: 
1- Create 500 labs.
2- Learn Object Oriented Programs by doing.

I hope to see a big difference in my coding at the end of the labs ^_^ .

Help me with exciting questions. You could help me requesting a pull to my Lab_Questions.md

Thank you.
